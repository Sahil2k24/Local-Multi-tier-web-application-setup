In this project, a robust multi-tier web application has been established locally, employing a comprehensive set of services to ensure seamless functionality. The architectural components include Nginx for efficient web server capabilities, Tomcat for Java-based web application hosting, RabbitMQ for reliable message queuing, Memcached for high-performance caching, and MySQL for robust database management. The entire setup has been orchestrated using Vagrant, allowing for a streamlined and reproducible deployment environment. The implementation leverages the power of data bash scripts to automate the configuration of each service, promoting consistency and ease of management. Version control is facilitated through Gitbash, enabling efficient collaboration and tracking of code changes. Linux commands have been instrumental in managing and optimizing the various components of the web application stack. This project showcases a comprehensive and well-integrated solution, utilizing a combination of cutting-edge tools and technologies to create a locally-hosted, scalable, and efficient multi-tier web application.
